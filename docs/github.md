# GitHub CI/CD Setup

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. We have three main
workflows:

## Build Workflow

The build workflow runs on every pull request and when libraries are updated. It performs the
following tasks:

- Validates Gradle wrapper
- Sets up JDK 21
- Runs code style checks using Spotless
- Builds the project

> [!NOTE]
> The build workflow runs automatically and requires no additional setup.

## Documentation Workflow

The documentation workflow runs whenever changes are pushed to the main branch. It:

- Sets up Python and required dependencies
- Generates API documentation using Dokka
- Deploys documentation to GitHub Pages

> [!NOTE]
> The documentation workflow runs automatically and requires no additional setup. Make sure your
> repository has GitHub Pages enabled in the settings.

## Release Workflow

The release workflow is triggered when you push a tag with the format `v*.*.*` (e.g., v1.0.0). It:

- Builds a signed release APK
- Creates a GitHub release with the APK
- Deploys to Google Play Store using Fastlane

### Prerequisites

Before you can use the release workflow, you need to set up the following GitHub secrets:

1. `GOOGLE_SERVICES`: Base64 encoded content of your `google-services.json` file
	```bash
	base64 -i google-services.json | tr -d '\n'
	```

2. `KEYSTORE`: Base64 encoded content of your keystore file
	```bash
	base64 -i your-keystore.jks | tr -d '\n'
	```

3. `KEYSTORE_PROPERTIES`: Base64 encoded content of your keystore.properties file containing:
	```properties
	storeFile=key.jks
	storePassword=your-store-password
	keyAlias=your-key-alias
	keyPassword=your-key-password
	```
 
4. `PLAY_STORE_JSON`: Base64 encoded content of your `play-store.json` file
	```bash
	base64 -i play-store.json | tr -d '\n'
	```

> [!WARNING]
> Never commit your keystore file, keystore properties, google-services.json or play-store.json
> directly to the repository.

### Creating a Release

To create a new release:

1. Update the `CHANGELOG.md` file with your release notes
2. Create and push a new tag:
	```bash
	git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
	git push origin v1.0.0
	```

The workflow will automatically:

- Generate a signed APK
- Create a GitHub release with the changelog
- Upload the APK to the release
- Deploy to Play Store via Fastlane

> [!TIP]
> Make sure your Fastlane setup is complete before using the release workflow. See
> the [Fastlane Setup](fastlane.md) guide for details.

### Debugging Failed Releases

If the release workflow fails, check:

1. GitHub Secrets are properly set
2. Tag format follows `v*.*.*` pattern
3. `CHANGELOG.md` exists and is properly formatted
4. Fastlane configuration is correct
5. Keystore and signing configuration match Play Store requirements

> [!NOTE]
> The workflow timeout is set to 45 minutes. For large projects, you might need to adjust this in
> the workflow file.
