# Fastlane and Play Store Setup

This project uses Fastlane to automate Play Store deployments. This guide will help you set up
Fastlane for your deployment needs.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. Ruby installed (version 2.5 or higher)
2. Bundler installed (`gem install bundler`)
3. A Google Play Console account with access to your app
4. A Play Store API service account (JSON key file)

## Initial Setup

1. Install Fastlane:
   ```bash
   gem install fastlane
   ```

2. Set up Play Store authentication:
	- Follow
	  the [Fastlane Play Store Setup Guide](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/upload_to_play_store/)
	  to create and download your `play-store.json` service account key
	- Place the `play-store.json` file in your fastlane directory

> [!NOTE]
> For detailed instructions about setting up Fastlane for Android, refer to
> the [official Android setup guide](https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/android/setup/).

> [!WARNING]
> Never commit your `play-store.json` file to the repository. Make sure it's included in your
> `.gitignore`.

## Configure Fastlane Files

### Appfile Configuration

Edit the `fastlane/Appfile` to configure your app-specific information:

```ruby
json_key_file("fastlane/play-store.json") # Path to your Play Store service account json file
package_name("dev.your.package.name") # Your app's package name
```

### Fastfile Configuration

Edit the `fastlane/Fastfile` to define your deployment lanes:

```ruby
default_platform(:android)

platform :android do
  desc "Deploy a new version to the Google Play"
  lane :deploy do
    # Upload to Play Store
    upload_to_play_store(
      track: 'internal', # or 'alpha', 'beta', 'production'
      aab: '../app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab',
      skip_upload_metadata: true,
      skip_upload_images: true,
      skip_upload_screenshots: true,
      release_status: "completed",
      version_code: ENV["VERSION_CODE"].to_i
    )
  end
end
```

## Metadata Management

The project includes a standard Fastlane metadata structure:

```
metadata/
└── android/
    └── en-US/
        ├── changelogs/
        ├── images/
        ├── full_description.txt
        ├── short_description.txt
        ├── title.txt
        └── video.txt
```

To pull existing metadata from Play Store:

```bash
fastlane supply init
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For `supply` to be able to initialize, you need to have successfully uploaded an APK to your app
> in the Google Play Console at least once.

> [!NOTE]
> This command downloads all your existing Play Store metadata and screenshots. It's useful when
> setting up a new machine or CI environment.

## Deploying Updates

1. Update your changelog:
	- Edit `fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/changelogs/default.txt`
	- Or create a version-specific changelog: `changelogs/<version_code>.txt`

2. Update app metadata (if needed):
	- Edit relevant files in `metadata/android/en-US/`
	- Update screenshots in `metadata/android/en-US/images/`

3. Run deployment:
   ```bash
   fastlane android deploy
   ```

> [!TIP]
> Our GitHub Actions workflow automatically runs the deployment when you create a new release tag.
> See the [GitHub CI/CD](github.md) guide for details.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Authentication Errors**:
	- Verify your `play-store.json` file is correctly placed
	- Ensure the service account has appropriate permissions in Play Console
	- Check if the JSON key is properly formatted

2. **Upload Failures**:
	- Verify your app's version code is incremented
	- Ensure the APK/AAB is properly signed
	- Check if the track (internal/alpha/beta/production) exists

3. **Metadata Issues**:
	- Validate all required metadata files exist
	- Check character limits in descriptions
	- Ensure screenshot dimensions meet Play Store requirements
